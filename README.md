# My-new-Project-Phase1

## How do I use this webpage?

The goal of my page, is that when you are comfortably at home, after a hard day at work, you can look in you bar, and depending on what bottles you have in it, quickly find a cocktail you can make !

## The language feature

The more people can understand what is written on the page, the better. Before you look for any cocktail, select your language by clicking on the flag.

## Radio buttons and text area for filtering through all the cocktails

The buttons help you filter what type of alcohol you have available at home, then you can browse through cocktails by choosing the initial letter of a cocktail you remember, or just choosing any letter !

## Getting the recipe

A list of cocktails will pop up, you then use the dropdown menu : if you are inspired by the name of that cocktail, select "yes" and the recipe will appear. If it doesn't sound delicious to you, just select "no" and keep browsing.

## The yummy counter

Once you read the recipe, you can click a button whether you think you want to try making it or not, it is just a fun feature for you to see at the end of your browsing if you were inspired and saw a lot of appealing recipe or not !

## Disclaimer

I just wanted to remember every user that drinking is better in moderation, and that there are some risks involved with drinking alcohol.
